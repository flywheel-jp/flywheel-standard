# FLYWHEEL Standard

An experimental repository of documents describing the standardized FLYWHEEL way.

* The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this repository are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
* In the event of a contradiction between ongoing way and the standard way, the ongoing one MAY take precedence over the documentation. However, all developers, repositories, and any other things related to our [DX](https://www.google.com/search?q=developer+experience) SHOULD make an effort to keep following the standard.
* All documents MUST be considered as living.
